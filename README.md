How to Use Sliders in Webflow

üîÑ Logo Slider

Add a div with #logo-slider as the ID and give it a class splide

Place logo images inside .splide__slide list items


Testimonial Slider

Use a div with #testimonial-slider-feedback as the ID give it a class splide

Each testimonial should be in a .splide__slide


These functions are already built into this Webflow theme.
// Logo Slider
function initLogoSlider() {
  new Splide('#logo-slider', {
    type: 'loop',
    perPage: 4,
    gap: '2rem',
    arrows: false,
    pagination: false,
    drag: false,
    autoScroll: { speed: 1 },
    breakpoints: {
      991: { perPage: 3 },
      767: { perPage: 2 },
      480: { perPage: 1 },
    },
  }).mount(window.splide.Extensions);
}

// Testimonial Feedback Slider
function initFeedbackSlider() {
  const slider = new Splide("#testimonial-slider-feedback", {
    type: "fade",
    rewind: true,
    autoplay: true,
    interval: 2000,
    speed: 800,
    arrows: true,
    pagination: false,
  });

  slider.mount();
}

Simply call the function on the page where you want to use the slider. Make sure to remove any unused functions to keep the code clean. For example:
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  const autoScroll = window.splide.Extensions.AutoScroll;
	initHeroSlider();
  initFrontSlider(autoScroll);
  initBackSlider(autoScroll);
  initTestimonialSlider();
});
</script>


üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Notes

Scripts are modular and scoped to avoid conflicts

CSS is kept minimal to allow Webflow designers full control

You can customize text animations via text-animations.js
